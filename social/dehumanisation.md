# Rethinking dehumanisation in Human Atrocities

## Flexible social cognition

social cognition can be withheld from people
- resources not recruited

social context + goals may reduce social cognition

emotional process may prohibit goal congruent behavior


## strategies

animal or robotic dehumanisation

## robots / computers
anthropomorphization

currently social cognition is withheld from computers ATM
ongoing AI debate - can AI be concious

## Function of Dehumanisation
- facilitate behaviour not reserved for human beings
  - moral disengagement
  - proactive emotion regulartion
- post-hoc justification for atrocious behaviour

## Type of harm matters
Approval of violence
- instrumental = by incident (cheap clothing etc)
  - higher approval when dehumanized
- moral
  - lower approval when dehumanized BUT not significant

## Incitement of violence
Paradigm
political speeches from real context (serbian Vojislav Seselj)

Independent coders

- DIrect threat (to us)
- past atrocities
- victimisation
- negative outgroup stereotype


neural activity response to coders
Levator response
- especially in revenge


## Torture study
- torture method intensity 0 - 10
- scream feedback
- result feedback detainee is still uncooperative vs cooperative
