# Modeling cognitive mechanisms in an embodied system
Dr Katie Twomey
Prof Angelo Cangelosi


what is cognitive development
mechanisms innate
- core knowledge
- object ontology
- syntactiv rules

vs

mechanisms learned
- usage based
- emergent
- associative

new paradigms for dev research
eyetracking, fnirs, eeg & 3d object studies

affecting development
- env
- social
- exloration
- intrinsic

>> Mechanisms are still unclear


# Language Learning
6-9 some words
39 mos 600 words

1/3 mechanisms for 
metacognition - what do i know already

>>> Developmental robotics can help finding the mechanisms

# Experiment I
Same trials and stimuli for iCub and kids

results for the unknown object identification tasks are similar for bots and kids

# Experiment II
challenges
- open ended learning
- scale
- syntax
- abstract concepts
- meta cognition

Because it maps so well on developmental stages it could be used to explain
