Why
- natural interactive vs screen
- experimental control

# Experiment
human follows robot
mutual gaze and gaze cueing

# Gaze following
jimmy vs dylan
75% vs 25%

latency of the return saccades 're-engagind' with the robot

# Robots as intentional systems

## A
does robot pass turing tests
external sound distracts robot
copy human eye movement onto robot
then: does human have mental state?


## B
mechanistic vs mentalistic evaluation

40% mentalistic bias results -  even though robot was seen

can we modulate this?
>> yes!
>> 
## Conclusion
- maintain human control in interactive scenarios
- alternative to screen-based

>> Planning intercultural studies for acceptance
>> 
## Q
gaze adaptation
- uncanney valley also for behavioristic rather than just formal aspects
