Leipziig universitÃ¤t


## First Study

## Second Study
dismissing attachment narrative styles
exclusion events
greater event potential

dismissing kids vs securely attached kids
more reaction to exclusion events

## Study
Preschool to school transition
cardiac slowing data
decelerration = expectancy violation

1. mediational model
- peer problems
- 

rejection

expected greater 

oversampled for high-emotional symptoms



>> no difference 

more positive mother representations predicts more pronounced cardiac deceleration

low pos = less cardical slowimg
were expecting the exclusion event



what contexts promote generalization
- social exclusion
- other non-negative events
- positive events
what processes underlie generalization
- expectancy violation
- emotion regulation, mentailizing, attentional processes
