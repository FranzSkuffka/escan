body & image in arts & science

how do we bodily relate and respond to others in a culture powered by images

photography of suffering has numbed audience -> apathy and indifference

empathy vs apathy

Montages
Framing / expertise / algorithms

experiment
1. rate images between little and much arousal
2. decide if pictures are real and confidence

> younger people less arousal
> more arousal > more likely to be real
> younger people more likely classify images as real > younger participants drive judgement less by arousal?

> greater surprise if aroused and they rated it as fake lateron

> the way questions were asked correlated with whether image was judged as fake

> how novel and how emotional, affect and salience = fake news potential

pol orientation only matters when framing the question of real or fake
