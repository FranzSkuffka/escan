# casual involvement of vagus in recognition of emotion


VNS afferent pathway to to the brain
nucleus of solitary tract
locus cereuleo
insula


tVNS easy item recognition improved
salient social cues are improved


dorsal vagal
sympathetic
    social activity
ventral vagal


## new research

adjustment = remove irrelevant representation
conflict = cognitive conflict - stop while driving e.g.

contextual control regulation - no homunculus

- functionality and affective property of the conflict signal
- aversive quality

- motivate evasion

neuromodulartory systems
dopaminergic system 
noradrenergic system

## new research
oddball task


# tVNS on negative thought intrusions in chronic worriers

worrying is core of stress-related illness
decreased inhibitory control - autonomic and central nervous system

efferent = top-down

vagus regulates heart = correlation
