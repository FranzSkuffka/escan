## Attack and DEfense in InterGroup Conflict
2 strategic responses people have: attack and defenense
conflic t- history, bio, pol, 

prisoner's dilemma
2 parties
2 prisoners
betraying vs staying silent
silent: both -1
loser: -3
both betray: -2

Predator prey, group raids


>>> Hostile take-over (bidding in industry)

# It's not prisoner's dilemma
argument: this is not prisoner's dilemma


predator / prey GHP - ~ 30% attack success rate
attacker country - - less than 30%

# New model
10 euro for 2 persons each
One can invest into attack or defense

roles are 

exceed or match for successful defense
exceed for successful attack


defenders are more hisitant
attackers win 30% of the time
max investment is 7


Amygdala - correlates positively with defense
attack is anticorrelates


# neural correlates
attackers have little activity
maximizing the number of kills
cost does not matter

defenders have wide activity
defenders minimize risk

attack = focused task on just killing

# attack (not Defense) Depends on Social Prefences
investment in attack is negatively correlated with prosocial prefecenes


cognitive taxation is making people more aggressive
latency correlates with forcefulness of attack

# attack (not defense) dependes on prefrontal control
- regulating frequency up or down for right IFG (inferior frontal guyros)
- if we upregulate IFG attackers they become less aggressive
- upregulation does not make attackers earn more money
- 
- smart attackers track when defenses are up
- upregulating make defender weaker
- cognitive control does not make less aggressive
- regulation makes us shrewd / 

Attackes invest to kill
- strategic, slow, mitigated by pro sociial, 33% 
def
- immune to pref
- 67% survival rate
- sub-cortical, use amygdala resources
- 

# When we attack (defend against) them
how to decide when and who invests

biobehav
- free-riding vs self-sacrifice
- neurohormones

culture
- norm-enforcmet, peer punish
- decision controls

Two setups
similtaneous investment in entire group
sequential decision protocol

reduced variance when coordination
attackers win more often if there is a leader
>>> the better attacker groups coordinates behaviour the higher the success rate

# understanding conflict
model it properly
in within AD
group 

- attack is 
# Questions

roles are separated in the experiment

what's the success rate for industry takeover

7 = 70% of ten
30% = 3 of ten

literature on takeover

in gorup winner-takes all or winner of each round?
leader influence on defense
